<h2>Regarding status of the project</h2>
As many people have been asking me what is going on (or not) with it-sec-catalog, here is the answer.<br>
Currently project requires a complete revamp - there are some articles missing information like CVEs, having wrong category, or probably having broken links. I also want to rename several categories, add new columns, and remove some. Also migration to GitBooks is supposed to be done until autumn. This is a lot of work to do, so please be patient.<br>
<br>
PS: "Export to GitHub" is broken.<br>
